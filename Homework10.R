#Homework 10
#1- seems that hypothesis have to be about values of parameters

#2
#a) comply with rules
#b) no because if it = 20 then both are true, can't include equality
#c) Ha can't include equality
#d) The value in H0 must also appear in Ha
#e) Each S is static so hypothesis doesn't comply
#f) Ha cant include equality
#g) complies with rules
#h) complies with rules

#3
#a) .001 < .05, reject H0
#b) .026 < .05, reject H0
#c) .079 > .05, accept H0
#d) .047 < .05, reject H0
#e) .142 > .05, accept H0

#4
#Same logic as problem 3, if P-value is greater accept, if less than a then reject

#We want to see if it exceeds 100lb to double check if its strong enough i think/ if it needs to be stronger
